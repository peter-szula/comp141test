Hi there!
This is a new file.
I suppose this concedes my journey in the wonderful course of COMP 141,
and an amazing first semester at Loyola University Chicago!
*p.s: EIGHT-AND-OH, GO 'BLERS!!! MARCH MADNESS AIN'T READY!*
Thanks to all of my awesome professors, and thank you Professor Sikdar!

Signing out, Peter :)
